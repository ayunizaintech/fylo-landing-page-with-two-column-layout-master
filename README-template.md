## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Bootstrap 5
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned how to use:
- Bootstrap 5
- Classes
- Divs
- Ordering
- Flexbox
- Writing nested divs
- Utilities



### Continued development

This project is done to the best of my ability within one week. I still have a few things to fix but overall, I am satisfied with my learning and progress. 

What I would like to focus on next:
- Change the form input placeholder font color to softer grey. 
- Make the logo in the desktop version bigger.
- Make the headers "Stay productive" and "Get early access today" smaller in mobile version.
